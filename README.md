## 📌 Overview

This project predicts whether an e-commerce product will become successful using **only the first 4 weeks of review data**.

👉 Success is defined as:
> Top 10% of products in the same category based on lifetime review count

🎯 Goal:
- Help sellers identify **high-potential products early**
- Avoid waiting months for full sales data

---

## 💡 Motivation

Online sellers often face uncertainty:
- Which product should I invest in?
- Which product will succeed?

Instead of waiting months, we use:
- Early review behavior
- Engagement signals

➡️ To predict future success quickly

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **Amazon Reviews Dataset (UCSD / McAuley Lab)**  

🔗 https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html  

### Categories Used:
- Electronics  
- Clothing, Shoes, Jewelry  
- Tools & Home Improvement  
- Toys & Games  
- Sports & Outdoors  

### Sampling:
- 10,000 products per category  
- 50,000 total products  
- Label: Top 10% = Successful  

📦 Stored in Google Cloud Storage:

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

We extract features from **first 4 weeks only**:

- Review count
- Reviews per day (velocity)
- Mean / median / min / max rating
- Rating standard deviation
- Helpful votes
- Votes per review
- Review text length
- Product category

---

## 🤖 Models

### 1. Logistic Regression
- Simple baseline
- Easy to interpret

### 2. XGBoost
- Captures nonlinear relationships
- Handles feature interactions better

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Because dataset is imbalanced (Top 10%):

- ROC-AUC  
- Average Precision  
- Precision / Recall / F1  
- ⭐ Precision@K (most important)

👉 We treat this as a **ranking problem**, not just classification.

---

## 📊 Results

| Model | ROC-AUC | Precision@K |
|------|--------|------------|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.638 | ~0.257 |
| XGBoost | ~0.679 | ~0.287 |

✅ XGBoost performs better across most metrics

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Early data is useful
First 4 weeks already contain predictive signals

### 2. Engagement > Rating
Better predictors:
- Review count
- Votes
- Velocity

Ratings alone are weak (most products are already 4–5⭐)

### 3. Category matters
Performance varies by product category

## 🔌 API Example

### Endpoint:
POST /predict

### Input:
```json
{
  "n_reviews_4w": 10,
  "mean_rating_4w": 4.5,
  "reviews_per_day_4w": 0.5,

🔮 Future Work
Add NLP sentiment features
Try different time windows (2, 4, 8 weeks)
Category-specific models
Improve label definition
Connect UI → API live prediction
✅ Conclusion
Early review data is useful but not perfect
Engagement signals outperform rating
XGBoost gives best performance

👉 Best use: ranking high-potential products early
